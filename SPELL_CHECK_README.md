# Spell Checking Guide

This repository includes an automated spell checking system for markdown and text files.

## Quick Start

Run the spell checker:
```bash
python3 spell_check.py
```

## What it does

The spell checker:
- ✅ Scans all `.md` and `.txt` files in the repository
- ✅ Ignores URLs, code blocks, and technical terms
- ✅ Prioritizes likely genuine spelling errors
- ✅ Generates a comprehensive report (`SPELLING_REPORT.md`)

## Features

### Smart Filtering
- Ignores code blocks (```...```)
- Ignores inline code (`...`)
- Ignores URLs and email addresses
- Ignores file paths and technical abbreviations
- Has an extensive dictionary of programming and technical terms

### Priority Detection
The spell checker identifies high-confidence spelling errors and lists them at the top of the report with suggested corrections.

### Comprehensive Reporting
- Summary statistics
- Line-by-line error details
- Suggested corrections for common misspellings

## Understanding the Report

The generated `SPELLING_REPORT.md` contains:

1. **Summary** - Overview of files checked and errors found
2. **Priority Misspellings** - High-confidence errors that should be fixed first
3. **Errors by File** - Detailed breakdown of all potential issues

## Common Workflow

1. Run `python3 spell_check.py`
2. Review the **Priority Misspellings** section first
3. Fix genuine spelling errors in the source files
4. Add legitimate technical terms to the spell checker's dictionary if needed
5. Re-run to verify fixes

## Customizing the Dictionary

To add technical terms that are being incorrectly flagged:

1. Edit `spell_check.py`
2. Add terms to the `technical_words` set
3. Re-run the spell checker

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- aspell (GNU Aspell spell checker)

Install aspell on Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt install aspell aspell-en
```

## Files Checked

The spell checker processes:
- All `.md` (Markdown) files
- All `.txt` (Text) files
- Excludes hidden files (starting with `.`)
- Excludes build artifacts and dependencies

## Recent Fixes

The following spelling errors have been corrected:
- ✅ "useful" (was "useful") in `eclipse.md`
- ✅ "comparison" (was "comparison") in `3d.md`
- ✅ "bluetooth keyboard" (was "bluetooth keyboard") in `todo.md`
- ✅ "appender stream" (was "appender stream") in `todo.md`
