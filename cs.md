### co-prime
>>> 
Co-prime numbers are pairs of numbers that do not have any common factor other than 1. There should be a minimum of two numbers to form a set of co-prime numbers. Such numbers have only 1 as their highest common factor, for example, (4 and 7), (5, 7, 9) are co-prime numbers


### prime and co-prime
>>> A prime number is a number that has exactly two factors, 1 and the number itself. For example, 2, 3, 7, 11 and so on are prime numbers. Co-prime numbers are pairs of numbers whose HCF (Highest Common Factor) is 1. For example, (4,9) are co-primes because their only common factor is 1.
