### Math
### co-prime
> Co-prime numbers are pairs of numbers that do not have any common factor other than 1. There should be a minimum of two numbers to form a set of co-prime numbers. Such numbers have only 1 as their highest common factor, for example, (4 and 7), (5, 7, 9) are co-prime numbers


### prime and co-prime
> A prime number is a number that has exactly two factors, 1 and the number itself. For example, 2, 3, 7, 11 and so on are prime numbers. Co-prime numbers are pairs of numbers whose HCF (Highest Common Factor) is 1. For example, (4,9) are co-primes because their only common factor is 1.

> In number theory, two integers a and b are coprime, relatively prime or mutually prime if the only positive integer that is a divisor of both of them is 1.[1] Consequently, any prime number that divides a does not divide b, and vice versa. This is equivalent to their greatest common divisor (GCD) being 1.[2] One says also a is prime to b or a is coprime with b.

> The numbers 8 and 9 are coprime, despite the fact that neither considered individually is a prime number, since 1 is their only common divisor. On the other hand, 6 and 9 are not coprime, because they are both divisible by 3.

### are prime numbers coprime
> For example: (11, 13) Here, 11 and 13 are coprime numbers, and their LCM is 11 Ã— 13 = 143 . Because prime numbers only share one common factor, 1, any two prime numbers are always coprime.
