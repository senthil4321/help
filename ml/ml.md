## Terminilogy

- **Machine Learning**: Teaching computers to learn patterns from data without explicit programming
- **Linear Regression**: A method to predict continuous values using a straight line equation
- **Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm that finds minimum loss by following the steepest downhill direction
- **Training**: The process of teaching a model by showing it examples and adjusting parameters
- **Model**: The mathematical representation that learns patterns (here: a single linear layer)
- **Parameters**: The learnable values in a model (weights and biases)
- **Loss**: A measure of how wrong the model's predictions are
- **Epoch**: One complete pass through all training data
- **Forward Pass**: Computing predictions through the model
- **Backward Pass**: Computing gradients to know how to improve parameters
- **Optimization**: The process of finding the best parameters to minimize loss
- **Inference/Prediction**: Using a trained model to make predictions on new data
